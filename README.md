Project for YRS 2014

This is our project. It is a way to control your house, but without actually moving. It facilitates Made line's laziness.

~*Tamaras ideas stuff*~
- if person in minecraft leaves house without "locking" (closing door), text sent to phone alerting user to this
- Temp inside house technically cant reach 50 degrees as the range we have given is about 15-27 degrees?

~*Discussion thing*~

Oops, I didn't realise about the temperature limits; I'll have to adjust the values tomorrow as some of the features would theoretically require it to go above 27 too.

I tidied some of the HTML and JS up and moved some about to make it a bit easier to navigate and edit should the server IP change. I've moved some functions to "/js/pod.js" and updated all code to match that. I've not added anything in terms of content, though. I also sorted the CSS and JS imports out in the headers and downloaded a local copy of the bootstrap and jQuery JavaScript files and included them in every document. ~ Ashley
