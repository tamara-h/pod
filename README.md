Project for YRS 2014

This is our project. It is a way to control your house, but without actually moving. It facilitates Made line's laziness.

~*Tamaras ideas stuff*~
- if person in minecraft leaves house without "locking" (closing door), text sent to phone alerting user to this
- Temp inside house technically cant reach 50 degrees as the range we have given is about 15-27 degrees?
-- Oops, I didn't realise; I'll have to adjust the values tomorrow as some of the features would theoretically require it to go above 27 too. ~ Ashley
