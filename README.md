Project for YRS 2014

This is our project. It is a way to control your house, but without actually moving. It facilitates Made line's laziness.

~*Tamaras ideas stuff*~
- if person in minecraft leaves house without "locking" (closing door), text sent to phone alerting user to this
- Temp inside house technically cant reach 50 degrees as the range we have given is about 15-27 degrees?

~*Discussion thing*~

Oops, I didn't realise about the temperature limits; I'll have to adjust the values tomorrow as some of the features would theoretically require it to go above 27 too.
--> temp range can be viewed under webpage/temp.html but can be increased if need be- can also be changed to a slider but that looked gross

I tidied some of the HTML and JS up and moved some about to make it a bit easier to navigate and edit should the server IP change. I've moved some functions to "/js/pod.js" and updated all code to match that. I've not added anything in terms of content, though. I also sorted the CSS and JS imports out in the headers and downloaded a local copy of the bootstrap and jQuery JavaScript files and included them in every document. ~ Ashley
--> cool . We may also want to put the python scripts running the Twilio stuff with the other python stuff but that can be done tomorrow easy B)
--> Yeah, that shouldn't be too hard. I'm going to merge a branch onto main if I can, it might override some of your changes but I'll manually review all of them straight after and re-change everything you've changed. Sorry about that!
